A. Stringer (Allometry Stringer)

This script is designed for RuneDev and is intended for stringing amulets with
the lunar string jewelery spell at any bank, including the grand exchange.

Before starting this script, ensure that your bank is currently showing both
unstrung and strung gold amulets on the same tab. This script will not look for your
bank items!

In addition, it is recommended that you sell your amulets at or above market
price. This script is capable of fluctuating market prices and a steep
decrease in strung amulet's price would make this script non-profitable.
